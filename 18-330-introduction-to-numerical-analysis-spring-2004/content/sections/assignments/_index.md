The problem sets were due in the lecture sessions essentially every Friday. The first two PSets dealt almost entirely with **root finding**, and the next four not only with single and multiple **integrals** but also with **interpolations** and the **acceleration** of convergence of sums and products. After the spring break, PSets 7-9 dwelled on **ODE** solutions and some **special functions**, while our last 3 PSets were devoted wholly to **numerical linear algebra.**
